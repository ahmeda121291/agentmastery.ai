## Introduction

In today's competitive landscape, revenue operations (RevOps) has emerged as a crucial discipline for businesses aiming to streamline their processes, enhance customer experiences, and ultimately drive revenue growth. This integrated approach aligns sales, marketing, and customer success teams around shared goals, ensuring that everyone is working towards the same objectives.
